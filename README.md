# A2SV Program Submissions
As a participant in the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) remote program, this repository serves as a testament to the consistent effort and daily work put into completing the program's coding challenges. The submissions contained herein represent a mere 1% of the total work and progress I have achieved alongside the program. The vast majority of my journey and accomplishments with A2SV are detailed and stored within their official platform.
